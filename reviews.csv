Unhappy,"I have a 2023 Corolla hatchback and from day one have been having problems with this app. From consistently signing me out of the app, to not allowing me to connect my Apple car play(it gives me the QR code to scan, and goes absolutely nowhere from there)and also not connecting for phone calls. I am deeply annoyed with this app and embarrassed for Toyota who normally puts out fine and working products. Bluetooth doesn‚Äôt stay connected to my phone either and I have an iPhone 15 pro max. I‚Äôve uninstalled the app in frustration and don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be reinstalling it anytime soon.

Digital Key Doesn‚Äôt Work with Android,"The newer 2024 Grand Highlander has an option to share 7 digital keys beyond your own through the Toyota app.  However, Toyota has chosen not to support Android.  Don‚Äôt even waste your time trying to make it work.  After many hours of working with the dealer and Toyota Brand Engagement, it was confirmed in writing from the dealer that Toyota doesn‚Äôt support Android for sharing digital keys.  There‚Äôs a list that says Pixel 7/8 will work, but I have confirmed that the Pixel 8 doesn‚Äôt work. Apple iPhone is your only choice for a shared digital key, which I have confirmed works multiple times. It‚Äôs sad because I had hoped to use my wife‚Äôs Android as a backup key because Toyota is shipping vehicles with only one FOB ‚Äì another unpleasant surprise. I hope this discovery saves others time.","2.00",TOYOTA,IOS
Image of car is backwards,"The app finally appeared to be working properly. I loved the status bar for the remote start. It was looking up. Then I get in my car to find I have low tire pressure somewhere. I check my app, and find the pressure is dangerously low, allegedly, for my front driver‚Äôs side tire. For it to be as low as it was it could only mean I had a leak. I check it and can‚Äôt find any tears or nails. It‚Äôs night, so I check again in the morning and still can‚Äôt find anything. No clue what to do, I decide I‚Äôll just go fill my tire and hope for the best. Before I did, though, I checked all my tires just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt missing something and find a nail in the rear passenger tire. That‚Äôs where the leak was. I‚Äôm so frustrated with this app! One thing is fixed for another thing to be messed up. And to be sure, the picture shows the tire near the mirror is the one with the issue, but that‚Äôs not the one actually messed up.","1.00",TOYOTA,IOS
Digital key won‚Äôt connect,"I‚Äôve had my new Toyota for almost 2 months now and cannot get the digital key to connect after numerous attempts, reinstalls, etc. finding someone to talk to at Toyota about this is nearly impossible. The dealer has been as helpful as they can but I keep getting ‚Äúinternal server error‚Äù messages.

Sometimes I can use digital key to get in the car, but then it won't start...then I go about restarting my phone and all that...it will eventually work. But 5 minutes to get the car running isn't more efficient. Even though I lock the car with the door handle spot, I'll get an alert from the app that the door isn't locked.

Annoying Quirks,"The app is decent but significantly underwhelming. Two big complaints:
1) why do users have to allow the app to connect to the car literally every time the vehicle starts? The car should be a trusted device and the app and car should auto sync starting from the first day it‚Äôs connected. We should not have to reauthorize the app each time. If you don‚Äôt connect fast enough, you have to turn the car off and on again to establish the ability to connect. This seems like a huge oversight and should be fixed immediately.
2) I get notified if my windows are left down, but the app should the ability to remotely put the windows up or down.
Other than that the basic info accessibility is nice and the ability to remote start is great.","2.00",TOYOTA,IOS
App is useless. Fix it Toyota!,"App is seriously flawed. Continual issues with connecting to my Grand Highlander, downloading the digital key seems impossible, and I receive notifications of the doors being unlocked when they are in fact locked.

I received an email that my payment was posted and don‚Äôt have to worry from there on and then I get a bunch of calls asking why I missed my payment. I received ONE follow up email saying I missed my payment 3 weeks after I submitted a payment and same with this month! They could have sent me an email the MOMENT it didn‚Äôt go through but no, 3 WEEKS LATER!!! They say they‚Äôve reached out but I‚Äôve asked to change that phone number every time I‚Äôve had my car serviced. Literally the worst app out there.

"80 annually or 96 for a year monthly is it worth it?","First off for 80 annually or 96 for a year (on a monthly basis) is it worth it? 
Only you can decide! However the app lacks a lot of functionality. 
 To start with let‚Äôs say you just want to view your vehicles warranty‚Äôs and coverages? Hmm not there (you‚Äôd think it would be a relevant & helpful bit of information readily available as the app certainly suggests maintenance, advertising and appointments!) But nope, nothing about all yur coverages or your included no charge maintenance! Very Poor!!
 Then there‚Äôs simple niceties like say within maybe vehicle status area or somewhere, anywhere in app displaying ambient even interior temperatures. (Maybe it does need to be remote-started? I can‚Äôt tell from where it‚Äôs parked as can‚Äôt see it) Hmm 
 From my 2Yr experience only positive I can say there is the car began to auto-enable rear/mirror defrost function on its own based on some parameter? So hats off there 
 Another annoying thing of mentioning is that there is no user settings for remote start regardless of temperatures. No matter what you get two 10 minute cycles and that barely get ya in the door up north & hardly cool it down south! 
 But worse is Toyota still insisting on shutting the vehicle off upon opening a door rather than a brake pedal. 
The car won‚Äôt come outta gear and short of ripping apart the interior there‚Äôs no easy overide for the (brake/park/interlock) so why kill the engine the second you open a door!!!! Terrible compared to other makes! 
Lastly and most importantly is hoping you don‚Äôt have to deal with Toyota connected services on anything because in 2 years time on a new Toyota I‚Äôve had to fight with them to even get their end of things going! Services are only free 1 year and had to fight for that, then had to fight to get back activated on billing and as I write this I‚Äôm now fighting a 3rd time in 2 yrs to get my vehicle back on !!!","1.00",TOYOTA,IOS

First class ticket to a worn out starter. Second for the cost of the options for this app is quite ridiculous.

Constantly Crashes,"The most recent update to this app (June 2024) is extremely unstable. It constantly crashes, in the middle of use. I notice this most often on the Status tab (simply due to the fact that it is the one I check, most often on my plug-in hybrid) I can rarely use the app for more than a minute, before it crashes and I have to relaunch it. Prior versions did not suffer this problem. Either a bug was introduced in the most recent version, or there was an existing code issue that conflicted with the most recent iOS update. Regardless, it makes this app extremely difficult to use.
Additionally, why doesn‚Äôt the Apple Watch integration include a complication??  The first image used in this apps illustration of features is of the access to features via your watch; but without a complication, accessing that feature is more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. If I could quickly launch it via a complication, it might be useful, but having to scroll through all of my installed phone apps to locate and launch, (especially if I‚Äôm in a parking lot) is too distracting.

Essential Updates Needed for the Lexus App,"The Lexus app is a useful tool for managing and monitoring your vehicle, but there are several updates and features that could significantly improve the user experience and functionality:
	1.	Auto Refresh Feature: One of the most critical updates needed is the implementation of an auto-refresh feature. Currently, users have to manually refresh the app to get the latest status of their car. An auto-refresh feature would ensure that the app always displays the most current information, enhancing convenience and reliability.
	2.	Temperature Display: It would be extremely beneficial if the app could display the temperature inside the car. This feature would allow users to monitor the interior climate of their vehicle remotely, ensuring comfort before they even step inside.
	3.	Improved Charging Schedule Options: The most crucial update needed is in the charging schedule settings. Currently, the app allows users to set a time limit for charging. However, for better battery health and efficiency, it is essential to have an option to set a charge limit (such as 90% or 80%). This feature would help in extending the battery life by preventing overcharging and optimizing the charging process.
Overall, while the Lexus app is functional, these updates would greatly enhance its utility and user satisfaction. Implementing auto-refresh, adding temperature monitoring, and offering more precise charging options would make the app an indispensable tool for Lexus owners.","2.00",LEXUS,IOS
Enormously frustrating and buggy,"Almost all functionality is buggy:

"","This is an excellent app for owners of new Toyota vehicles.

Lacking in basic functionality,"The only goal I have with this app is to make my life easier by allowing me to remote start my car. 
Imo the service is vastly overpriced at 15/month, but that‚Äôs a separate issue from the app itself.
My main source of frustration with this app is that it barely works. As other reviews mention you have to log in EVERY time you use it. There‚Äôs a fascade of convenience with a ‚Äúremember me‚Äù input and face id on the login screen but neither have ever worked for me. I also have attempted to use the iOS shortcut functionality but if something goes wrong it doesn‚Äôt tell you so it is a random chance every time I attempt to use it.
Lastly, having multiple users try to remote start a car is a joke. I would have thought that Toyota would have considered the case that 2 people would be sharing a car but clearly they haven‚Äôt put any attention into this whatsoever. Swapping between users who can remote start literally requires the other user to scan a QR code in the car every single time you want to switch the ‚Äúowner‚Äù of the car.

"Great car, lousy app","We bought a 2024 Toyota Highlander, which is a great car. Unfortunately the Toyota app is not.
For reference, we also have a Subaru & the app for Subaru is way better. I am so disappointed with the Toyota app because it doesn‚Äôt even come close to the functionality of Subaru‚Äôs.
The Toyota belongs to my husband & he is the primary driver, as well as the primary account holder on the app. The Toyota app allows him to grant me access as a remote user. I was able to link the car to my app, but I can‚Äôt do anything else, like unlock the doors or start the car. When I try to do any function on the app, it asks to make me the remote user, which removes my husband. OK fine, I try that but no function will actually work. The app asks me to scan the QR code for the car, even though I already completed this step (this is how I was able to link the car to my account on the app in the first place) 
Even though the car is linked to the app and I am now the designated remote user, it still wants me to scan a QR code. If I want to unlock the car from outside, how can I scan a QR *inside* the car??? It does this every time I try to do anything within the app. 
For comparison, my husband, daughter and I are all logged into our Subaru app. Any of us can remote start the Subaru or unlock the doors or whatever. We only had to set it up the first time; it doesn‚Äôt ask us to scan a QR code or anything like that. 
I am so frustrated with this Toyota app that I don‚Äôt ever want to buy a Toyota again. We have cold winters & the remote start is so useful to get the car warmed up.

Digital Key Doesn‚Äôt Work with Android,"The newer 2024 Grand Highlander has an option to share 7 digital keys beyond your own through the Toyota app. However, Toyota has chosen not to support Android. Don‚Äôt even waste your time trying to make it work. After many hours of working with the dealer and Toyota Brand Engagement, it was confirmed in writing from the dealer that Toyota doesn‚Äôt support Android for sharing digital keys. There‚Äôs a list that says Pixel 7/8 will work, but I have confirmed that the Pixel 8 doesn‚Äôt work. Apple iPhone is your only choice for a shared digital key, which I have confirmed works multiple times. It‚Äôs sad because I had hoped to use my wife‚Äôs Android as a backup key because Toyota is shipping vehicles with only one FOB ‚Äì another unpleasant surprise. I hope this discovery saves others time.  
Adding to review‚Ä¶ Stability of the app is terrible. After a recent update it lost the digital key from my iPhone 15 Pro. Had to call Toyota telematics for help to restore, which involved much technical acrobatics. Also, there are times when the iPhone is unable to start or unlock the car. Occasionally, closing and opening the app temporarily fixes the issue. Toyota and its app developers should be embarrassed as they‚Äôve lost face on app reliability.

How can Toyota Charge for This?,"Background:  we‚Äôve had a 2024 Prius Prime since March 2024.  The battery has died 4 times, it‚Äôs been towed once and jumped 3 times, has been to 2 different Toyota dealerships for service, we have been given a rental car twice, and the 12V battery has been replaced.
The last time it was at the dealership, we were told to never use the Toyota app and to delete it.  This is inconvenient for us, as we were using it to schedule charging, and to use the digital key, since we were only provided with one key fob, as is common on some Toyotas, due to a chip shortage.
This was several weeks ago, and the car has not suffered a dead battery since we stopped using the app.  Why on earth would Toyota sell a subscription for an app that sends so many messages to the app/cellphone that it causes the battery to die?  We are still on a free trial, but at this point wouldn‚Äôt consider a subscription that uses this app.  
We have had 5 Toyotas, this being our 3rd Prius in 17 years. This is the first problem we have had with any of them, and it all stems from this app, which is not ready for ‚ÄúPrime time‚Äù (pun intended).","1.00",TOYOTA,IOS

Features that came with prior cars are now subscription services,This subscription model needs to die out. Remote start was a staple package with other car models and brands with a one time payment at time of purchase and Toyota has made it a subscription for the life of their new vehicles. 80/year for something that we already had to pay for the feature at time of purchase and now have to continue to pay for to use. The dealership didn‚Äôt know about it either. Companies need to quit with the greed and be more consumer friendly.

(Read) Data collecting in new update !,"I‚Äôve had the app for a few years and it worked ‚Äú ok ‚Äú yes just ok, after having the app for a few years I questioned the value of what you pay yearly but still renewed for another year. After the recent update I will not be renewing anymore; here‚Äôs the reason: Like every application these days they want some of your most personal information. The new update forces you to consent to the ‚Äú Connected Services Master Data Consent ‚Äú which asks for your precise location information for not only Toyota but also its affiliates who ever they are for research and data analysis what ever that could be and if you decline every part of the app that convinced you to pay for the service in the first place is now consequently not available. So essentially Toyota is asking for things things that only your husband or wife may ask for your location and information 24/7 and not for free but for a monthly fee and if you don‚Äôt consent the app doesn‚Äôt work. Just another large corporation being extremely intrusive with their technology arm of their company. Read your terms of service before consenting these companies know you most likely won‚Äôt.

I love the phone and watch push notifications about the status of my vehicle and ability to pick and remote start if I want that.
In other feature that would be awesome would be to auto set the climate controls if remote starting on a hot or cold day. As well as having an option to close all the windows or at least the sun roof. Cracking open or fully closing .

Forced app update broke connectivity to my truck,"In short, this app is terrible. However prior to today it was still filed in the ‚Äúhas not done actual harm‚Äù category. That low bar was broken when the forced app update came with forced accept/decline of expansive, vague ‚Äúprivacy policies‚Äù including your locations, driving data, connected device data, and many other aspects that no person would ever actually want to share with a company that has been shown to resell that data for user-unfriendly uses without consent. Accepting or declining this new privacy policy is all or nothing. No choice to opt in and out of specific services. So by declining this massive overreach, the Toyota app immediately disabled all connected services, including but not limited to:
-Lock/unlock
-Remote start
-SOS (!)
-Service connect
-Etc.
The somehow-it-gets-worse part is that even after I‚Äôve gone into the data privacy portal and manually re-enabled the specific policies that govern the services I previously used (like Remote Connect to lock/unlock/start the car from the app), which, keep in mind, was not an option on the all or nothing accept/decline presented on app launch after update, my truck cannot connect to anything because the infotainment now says my vehicle is not capable of remote services. Now when I start my truck, about 60 seconds in a loud voice comes through the speaker telling me ‚Äúthe data connection module could not connect‚Äù or something to that effect, and that SOS will not work. 
I‚Äôve spent over an hour today on the phone with Toyota and each time I‚Äôve spoken with a new agent they tell me they‚Äôve received a bunch of calls like this since the app update went out. Yet they still don‚Äôt know how to resolve it. My case is being escalated along with thousands of others.

1 - digital key keeps being removed daily. Have to uninstall app and reinstall and then go through the download digital key process every day. Not worth the effort especially since this is part of a subscription. Will likely not renew for this reason. 
2 - when trying to enter work or home in app, (Find/Destinations - Home Setup/Work Setup) it does not search when pressing search. So no way to enter home or work. If I type in poi it will pull some listings up to select but my home is not a poi. 
Iphone 12 max pro and iphone 16 max pro. iOS 17 and 18. Same issues. 24 Tacoma with large screen. 
3 - for all that is good in this world, please allow for more radio station favorites. Too few as it is now. Safety issue as we have to use display for other stations taking eyes off the road. 23 Camry had 36 I believe. That was a good amount. What do we get 12 now? Come on....

Poor for managing my EV,"Unfortunately this app is pretty bad at managing my Lexus RZ.

Only force closing the app resolves this and allows to cool the phone down.
Other issues:
1. Only one digital key can be assigned to anyone and only one person can work with the app per vehicle. 
2. The charging screen is very clunky and very slow. The app sometimes crashes on this screen.
3. The ‚Äúfind chargers‚Äù feature is always out of sync with the chargers in my area to the point where I‚Äôve stopped using it.

Constantly Crashes & No Updates,"(Updated 9/16/24) despite promises from Lexus Tech Support, back in June, that they already had a fix for the inability of the app to track charging history on the TX550H+, and that it would be included in the next release (which I was told occurred about once or twice per month) there hasn‚Äôt been a single app update, since June. The app continues to crash on a regular basis and is unable to recognize any charging history for my car. I guess that with the production stoppage of all TX models ( along with the Grand Highlander) for the airbag safety recall, they are no longer focused on implementing this fix, for the few individuals who actually purchased this model, prior to the halt in production. Definitely not what I had previously come to expect from Lexus‚Ä¶.
The most recent update to this app (June 2024) is extremely unstable. It constantly crashes, in the middle of use. I notice this most often on the Status tab (simply due to the fact that it is the one I check, most often on my plug-in hybrid) I can rarely use the app for more than a minute, before it crashes and I have to relaunch it. Prior versions did not suffer this problem. Either a bug was introduced in the most recent version, or there was an existing code issue that conflicted with the most recent iOS update. Regardless, it makes this app extremely difficult to use.
Additionally, why doesn‚Äôt the Apple Watch integration include a complication??  The first image used in this apps illustration of features is of the access to features via your watch; but without a complication, accessing that feature is more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. If I could quickly launch it via a complication, it might be useful, but having to scroll through all of my installed phone apps to locate and launch, (especially if I‚Äôm in a parking lot) is too distracting. It takes less time to launch the iPhone app off of my Home Screen and access features (assuming that the app doesn‚Äôt crash)","1.00",LEXUS,IOS

"",Useless,"1.00",TOYOTA,ANDROID
Digital Key So Unreliable It‚Äôs Useless,"The good: The app, for most part, will allow you to lock and unlock the car fairly reliably.
The bad: When the digital key is properly loaded in the app it often takes upwards of 30 seconds for the car to recognize that it‚Äôs nearby, even when standing directly next to the car with one hand on the door handle, the phone in the other hand, and the Lexus app open and running on the screen. So you end up standing outside your car repeatedly trying the handle, or in the car repeatedly trying to start the car for close to a minute until it eventually detects the connection from the digital key and works. This is a pretty subpar experience, however, this isn‚Äôt even the most fatal flaw of the digital key.
The digital key is so unreliable that it renders it completely useless. It constantly, sometimes after only a few hours, sometimes after a few days, disappears from the app and requires a redownload, only the download will consistently fail. The only fix is to completely delete and redownload the Lexus app. You can then download the key again, which will require you to redo the several step pairing process that requires you to be in the car with one of your physical key fobs to complete. The key will then stay in the app for a few hours, or maybe a few days if you‚Äôre lucky, until it disappears without warning, the process starts over, and you‚Äôre back to square one and need to delete the app again. Since this happens seemingly at random, and isn‚Äôt fixable without having your physical key fob to redo the pairing process, you simply can‚Äôt leave the house without your physical key or risk being stranded and unable to get home. This renders the digital key completely useless, it might as well not exist in its current form.
Lexus desperately needs to transition the digital key out of their own app and into Apple Wallet. Many other manufacturers do this and it works flawlessly. Stop trying to reinvent the wheel. Stick to what you‚Äôre good at, making cars, and leave the software side of things to the software experts.","1.00",LEXUS,IOS

The advertising makes it seem like the watch alone can be used to lock / unlock / start the vehicle but this is not true. When the watch is away from the phone it just says ‚Äúplease connect to your iPhone and try again‚Äù, disappointing. This functionality would be very helpful for water sports, runs or bike rides in questionable weather. I believe all of these frustrations would have been avoided if Lexus just implemented ‚ÄúApple Car Key‚Äù. I have used cars with that system and they just work, every time. Another, less critical, problem with the app is the inability to set up or modify the charging schedule from the app. When staying hotels, high rise buildings, or apartments with garages some distance away it would be helpful to implement a charging schedule with climate control remotely.

This functionality would be very helpful for water sports, runs or bike rides in questionable weather.  I believe all of these frustrations would have been avoided if Lexus just implemented ‚ÄúApple Car Key‚Äù.  I have used cars with that system and they just work, every time.   Another, less critical, problem with the app is the inability to set up or modify the charging schedule from the app.  When staying hotels, high rise buildings, or apartments with garages some distance away it would be helpful to implement a charging schedule with climate control remotely.  For such an amazing car it‚Äôs really disappointing to have an app this bad.   I really hope they fix it soon. I would really like to purchase a Lexus again but if the app ratings don‚Äôt improve I‚Äôll be looking elsewhere.","1.00",LEXUS,IOS

2) I‚Äôve noticed that since it‚Äôs getting 100 degrees where I live so need to turn the car on before hand to get the AC started cool when I enter at 60 degrees but if I manually set the temperature any degrees move 60 degrees the night before it will not  change the degrees so the air is pumping out warm or hot air into the car‚Ä¶
3) the app constantly asking me permission to connect from the app from my phone, this should be one time allow ask permission replacement instead, if the device not the main primary device for the car we shouldn‚Äôt need to be constantly have permission press the allow or ignore prompt when turn on the car and turning off just gets annoying and old.

I love that you can look up your owners manuals from the app because let‚Äôs face it you get A LOT of information in the owners manual and it can be overwhelming so I like that I can look at through the app at home and not have to worry about getting the actual manual.
What I never knew I would love is the ability to look at your drive pulse. It rates your driving and lets you know if you had a hard brake or took a corner too fast. I will be using it more as my daughter will be learning to drive soon. However, it‚Äôs been broken for awhile now. As soon as you click to see your drive pulse you are immediately booted from the app.
I also really love that you can see where your car was last parked. No more looking for your car aimlessly at a crowded shopping mall. I have to question the service record of my car. It is showing ‚Äúcustomer requested‚Äù all of the services for the 5,000 mile mark. Here is the issue. It was ‚Äúcustomer requested‚Äù 3 days AFTER I bought the car so this customer never requested it. But they have it listed as if it happened so conveniently for them that means that my warranty won‚Äôt cover the 5,000 maintenance. Because they lied and said it had been done already. And when I bought the car it wasn‚Äôt even at 5000 miles yet.","2.00",TOYOTA,IOS

Despite setting up an iPhone automation to ‚Äúdelay 21 seconds, then lock the car‚Äù when CarPlay disconnects, the app frequently logs me out, rendering the automation unreliable. At times, it works once or twice, but more often than not, I‚Äôm forced to sign back in repeatedly, which is extremely inconvenient.
Additionally, while the app supports Apple Watch, there‚Äôs no Toyota watch complication available to quickly access key functions. It would be far more practical to have this feature for easy integration with the watch face. I hope these issues can be addressed soon, as they‚Äôre detracting from an otherwise useful app.","2.00",TOYOTA,IOS

Also get an alert about the back seats but it doesn't say what's wrong or what page to go to in the 574 page manual.

I have not clue if the tracker to find my car should it be stolen or I forget where zi parked the works or not

The car is awesome but the app is terrible,"I made the mistake of buying the car before checking the app reviews.  I won‚Äôt make that mistake again.  It‚Äôs unbelievable that basic functionality is not working reliably.  It‚Äôs enraging to have to sign into the app manually every day even though ‚Äúkeep me signed in‚Äù it toggled on and Face ID is enabled.  Why does it need to send me a text every time, to sign in?  According to Lexus support, Sign in with Apple, doesn‚Äôt work so I have to use my phone number. This is basic stuff that should have been fixed before the app was ever released.  This has seriously diminished my new owners satisfaction.    Next issue is the digital key.  I‚Äôm on my 3rd call to customer service to get that working reliably.   It works for a while then needs to be downloaded again.  When trying to download it again there is an error that seemingly can‚Äôt be fixed without a call to ‚Äúconnected services‚Äù. In my experience it takes them 2-3 business days to resolve the issue.  This makes ‚Äúdigital key‚Äù useless.  It would have been nice if it could be relied upon.  One of the reasons I bought the car is that I like to do water sports. Taking my waterproof phone or watch would have been preferable to taking the (not waterproof) key card or fob.  A related issue is that the Apple Watch cannot be used for anything without the phone in range.  This is true even if the watch is connected to WiFi or cellular data.  The advertising makes it seem like the watch alone can be used to lock / unlock / start the vehicle but this is not true.  When the watch is away from the phone it just says ‚Äúplease connect to your iPhone and try again‚Äù, disappointing.  This functionality would be very helpful for water sports, runs or bike rides in questionable weather.  I believe all of these frustrations would have been avoided if Lexus just implemented ‚ÄúApple Car Key‚Äù.  I have used cars with that system and they just work, every time.   For such an amazing car it‚Äôs really disappointing to have an app this bad.   I really hope they fix it soon. I would really like to purchase a Lexus again but if the app ratings don‚Äôt improve I‚Äôll be looking elsewhere.  
10/6/24 update v2.5.4 still has the same issues with frequently logging me out even if ‚Äúkeep me logged in‚Äù is enabled.  It‚Äôs so frustrating because I found a workaround to the Apple Watch not working without the iPhone nearby.  I set up a shortcut so that I can say ‚ÄúSiri, (lock,unlock or start) Lexus.  It works great until the iPhone app randomly logs out then it won‚Äôt work again until I sign in on my iPhone.  I can‚Äôt believe they actually want to charge a monthly fee for this functionality once the free period is up.
11/4/24 update
Some new issues have cropped up.   The app randomly deletes my address. This makes the charging history show my charging location as unknown. Putting my address back in does not change this database entry.  It will always show as ‚Äúunknown‚Äù.  I have my car on a schedule so that it‚Äôs fully charged at 8am.  If I return from a trip and plug the car in it will wait until a time it determines appropriate to start charging.  The app has a button to ‚Äústart charging now‚Äù that overrides the schedule.  Problem is just looking around in the app causes the car to start charging.  The first few times it happened I gave it the benefit of the doubt.   I assumed I had accidentally hit the ‚Äúcharge now‚Äù button.  Now it‚Äôs happened enough that I know it wasn‚Äôt me hitting the button.  Under the health section there is section called ‚Äúservice campaigns‚Äù. I got a red dot notice that my 2nd key fob was ready to be delivered.  I had this service done a week ago and the red dot alert still shows. There is no way to clear the alert. It‚Äôs an annoying bug but it will also prevent me from noticing actual valid action items in this space.  I really hope they put some serious effort into improving this app.  The car is great but the app is really disappointing.","1.00",LEXUS,IOS

A Seamless Experience with the Lexus Mobile App!,"I recently started using the Lexus mobile app, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way! From the moment I downloaded it, the user interface was intuitive and visually appealing. Navigating through the app is a breeze, making it easy to access all the features I need.
One of the standout features for me is the ability to remotely start my vehicle. On chilly mornings, being able to warm up my car before stepping outside is a game-changer. The app also provides real-time updates on my vehicle‚Äôs status, including fuel level and maintenance alerts, which keeps me informed and helps me stay on top of my car‚Äôs needs.
I also appreciate the integrated navigation system. The ability to send destinations directly to my car‚Äôs navigation system is incredibly convenient, especially when I'm in a hurry. Plus, the app offers a comprehensive overview of nearby dealerships and service centers, complete with appointment scheduling‚Äîmaking maintenance so much easier.
Another highlight is the customer support feature. I‚Äôve had a couple of questions regarding my vehicle, and the chat support function was incredibly responsive and helpful.
Overall, the Lexus mobile app is a fantastic companion for any Lexus owner. It truly enhances the ownership experience, making it not only more convenient but also more enjoyable. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a seamless and efficient way to manage their Lexus! Five stars all the way! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü","5.00",LEXUS,IOS

I have not had any trouble with the Toyota apps, the truck itself, or the excellent customer service that had been given. I have felt with many different vehicle brands, including luxury brands. Toyota by far to me is the best built, best benefits and best total experience. If you can find my other reviews, I am not one to give anything a 10/10.

Why is this app so much worse than the Tesla app?,"There are many things that I do not miss about my Tesla (poorly designed Blindspot, monitoring, weird, doorhandles, insane, racist, and fascist CEO), but they did make a good app for my phone. Why is Toyotas app so much worse?
-Why does my phone not work as a car key? That was a great feature for the Tesla and meant that I never had to worry about grabbing my keys when leaving the house. It looks like it is available for some Toyota models, but not for my RAV4 prime?
Why do I always have to sign into the app? I already sign into my phone, so there really isn‚Äôt a need for an extra layer of security. And I don‚Äôt sign into my car keys, so there is already less security for the car there.
Why can‚Äôt I set the temperature in the car from the app?
Why can‚Äôt I close the windows or the sunroof from the app? I can lock the doors, which is useful, but if the app warns me that I have left the windows open, there is nothing I can do without going physically back to the car. 
Also, why do I have to hold down the lock button for several seconds in the app in order to lock the car (or the unlock button to unlock the car)? Is there an issue about accidentally locking or unlocking the car? On my car key, I don‚Äôt have to hold down the button for several seconds.","3.00",TOYOTA,IOS

1 I have set a charge schedule, but the car will start anytime I plug in !! 
2 mobile app does not have a ‚Äústop charge‚Äù function 
3 remote engine start stop is quirky - will not always start and send a random error message back.

The car is awesome but the app is terrible,"I made the mistake of buying the car before checking the app reviews.  I won‚Äôt make that mistake again.  It‚Äôs unbelievable that basic functionality is not working reliably.  It‚Äôs enraging to have to sign into the app manually every day even though ‚Äúkeep me signed in‚Äù it toggled on and Face ID is enabled.  Why does it need to send me a text every time, to sign in?  According to Lexus support, Sign in with Apple, doesn‚Äôt work so I have to use my phone number. This is basic stuff that should have been fixed before the app was ever released.  This has seriously diminished my new owners satisfaction.    Next issue is the digital key.  I‚Äôm on my 3rd call to customer service to get that working reliably.   It works for a while then needs to be downloaded again.  When trying to download it again there is an error that seemingly can‚Äôt be fixed without a call to ‚Äúconnected services‚Äù. In my experience it takes them 2-3 business days to resolve the issue.  This makes ‚Äúdigital key‚Äù useless.  It would have been nice if it could be relied upon.  One of the reasons I bought the car is that I like to do water sports. Taking my waterproof phone or watch would have been preferable to taking the (not waterproof) key card or fob.  A related issue is that the Apple Watch cannot be used for anything without the phone in range.  This is true even if the watch is connected to WiFi or cellular data.  The advertising makes it seem like the watch alone can be used to lock / unlock / start the vehicle but this is not true.  When the watch is away from the phone it just says ‚Äúplease connect to your iPhone and try again‚Äù, disappointing.  This functionality would be very helpful for water sports, runs or bike rides in questionable weather.  I believe all of these frustrations would have been avoided if Lexus just implemented ‚ÄúApple Car Key‚Äù.  I have used cars with that system and they just work, every time.   For such an amazing car it‚Äôs really disappointing to have an app this bad.   I really hope they fix it soon. I would really like to purchase a Lexus again but if the app ratings don‚Äôt improve I‚Äôll be looking elsewhere.  
10/6/24 update v2.5.4 still has the same issues with frequently logging me out even if ‚Äúkeep me logged in‚Äù is enabled.  It‚Äôs so frustrating because I found a workaround to the Apple Watch not working without the iPhone nearby.  I set up a shortcut so that I can say ‚ÄúSiri, (lock,unlock or start) Lexus.  It works great until the iPhone app randomly logs out then it won‚Äôt work again until I sign in on my iPhone.  I can‚Äôt believe they actually want to charge a monthly fee for this functionality once the free period is up.","1.00",LEXUS,IOS
